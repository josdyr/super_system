Many to many table always should be descriptive of what it really is. Is it a source, reply etc? e.g. issuestask table should be called "issuetasks". What is the correct name for PersonsPositions/PositionsPersons table?
Naming the systems and tables (at least for the authentic systems) for what it really is. Use e.g. wikipedia/synonyme/ordbok etc when finding names
