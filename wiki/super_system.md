[**super_system**](super_system.md) is just that, a _super_-_system_ that is "on top of" or the "master" of other sub systems. **super_system** manages all sub-systems beneath itself. the [system-user](super_user.md) is the user that makes and administers the system (through super-system), and the end-end user is the user that actually uses the system that the end-user has made.

**goal**: automate the tedious process of manually creating a system the "old fashioned" way, and rather prompts for a set of requiered and optional parameters to build/manage the system.
